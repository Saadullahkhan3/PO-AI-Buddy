# AI powered Terminal

Termianl with AI integration, 
you can just stop your AI
OR Told something to AI


## Way of using it?
I am confuse in three ways#one in abstraction of both

> To invoke our AI/Program, we will use `PO` keyword

### 1. Loop-Based

User will invoke our program and use it as terminal
if user want to invoke AI, can say like

```bash
$ PO #Invoke our program
$ echo Hello #normal cmd, no AI invoke "PO"
$ PO "Can you give me git cmd to push tags" #AI takes it, valid cmd -> No, so AI will process it, Invoked the AI via "PO"
$ exit #exit the program
```

### 2. Invoke Based
User will use normal terminal#like cmd
but for using AI, can directly invoke AI when needed
like

```bash
$ echo Hello #normal cmd
$ PO "<your-AI-query>" #only invoke AI when needed
```


### 3. Intelligent - Auto
    
Implicit, user will invoke our program as terminal just like in Loop-Based
but instead of explicitly calling AI#still can user just direct write 
query or cmd.
AI will detect that if it is valid cmd, just execute it
if not, AI will process it.

```bash
$ PO #Invoke our program
$ echo Hello #AI takes it, valid cmd -> Yes, just execute it
$ Can you give me git cmd to push tags #AI takes it, valid cmd -> No, so AI will process it
$ exit #exit the program
```

| Type | Explicit | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Loop Based | Yes | Call AI when needed but with-in our Terminal |
| Invoke Based | Yes | Call AI when needed but from anywhere | 
| Intelligent | No | AI will decide what to do |


Notes: 
1. Before executing the cmd, program will show the cmd and ask for permission
2. AI will/can/may be in loop when **prompted**, this mean if AI is processing something, it will keep it in its context until not completed. Like:
    ```bash
    $ PO "can you push it" # AI got invoked, keep context of talk
    $ AI: Here is cmd for push to remote origin main
        $ git push origin main
        Press y to execute it, n for exit this prompt-loop, or wirte your query: 
    $ No I do not want to push on origin, what are my remotes?
    $ AI: Oh, I get it, to see your remote, here its cmd
        $ git remote -v
        Press y to execute it, n for exit this prompt-loop, or wirte your query: 
    $ y
    $ git remote -v  # pasted by program
    $ origin  https://github.com/<usrename>/<repo-name>.git (fetch)
    $ origin  https://github.com/<usrename>/<repo-name>.git (push)
    $ # Below step may be implemented
    $ AI: Now what I need to do?
        Press y to execute it, n for exit this prompt-loop, or wirte your query: 
    $ n # AI exited, all loop context gone
    ```


## Questions 

Q1: Can Python Interfere in an Already Opened Terminal? (for 2, Invoke Based system)
- Directly injecting commands into another running terminal = very hacky (you’d need pseudo-terminal injection, OS signals, etc.).

Q2: Python gives you two solid choices:
- subprocess.run([...], capture_output=True) → capture stdout/stderr, then print it back.
Or pty module → gives more realistic shell behavior, but more complex.


## Summary
1st Loop-based program wins, for these reasons.
1. Easy to implement(context memory, showing the commad)


Why not Invoke-based?
1. Executing a cmd in a existing terminal via Python is not a easy task
2. Difficult to maintain context memory, actually eventually mini loop-based system

Why not Auto?
1. Expensive. 
2. Still needed to invoke our Program and use it as terminal(why just don't write "PO" prefix?)



Jo ke apki troubleshoot me help karega like hamare server per application ke ya services ke bht sare logs hote he means agar apke server per microservices chal rahi ho to apke pas bht sare logs hote he us me manually apko koi cheez investigate karna thora mushkil hota he to hum isko agar automate karde to ye blkl real world or helpfull project ho jaiga.
